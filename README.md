# Replex

Remix your plex recommendations.

![plot](./examplewithhero.png)

## Features

- Merge recommendations on home into one from different libraries. Aka have movies and shows in a single row.
- Remove watched items from recommendations.
- Choose between styles, shelf (default) or hero.
- Auto load tmdb artwork for hero styles.
- Disable user state: remove unwatched markers from artwork.
- Disable leaf count: remove episode count from artwork.
- Works on every client/app not only plex web!
- Plays nice with PMM (and without).

!!This does not alter your plex data in anyway. it only alters outgoing api requests. All your collections or rows are kept intact!!


## Installation

Run the docker image with REPLEX_HOST set to your plex instance.

```
docker run --rm -it -p 3001:80 -e REPLEX_HOST="http://PLEXIP:PLEXPORT" ghcr.io/sarendsen/replex:latest
```

add your proxy url to plex "Custom server access URLs" (ex http://0.0.0.0:3001)

then access your proxy url http://0.0.0.0:3001

Docker compose example including plex:

```yml
version: "3"
services:
  plex:
    image: lscr.io/linuxserver/plex:latest

[^1]: Only works in the web app.

## Mixed rows

Custom collections with the same name from different libraries will be merged into one on the home screen,
So an collection named "Trending" in the Movie library will be merged with an collection named "Trending" from a shows library on home.

Note, this does not work on builtin recommandations. As i personally dont see then need of mixing those. 
You can recreate the builtin rows with smart collections if you wish to have that functionality, or with PMM ofcourse.

## Hub style

You can change the hub style to hero elements by setting the label "REPLEXHERO" on an collection. 
Plex uses an the background artwork for hero elements. 
Often these dont have any text or are not suitable for hero artwork in general.
You can use tmdb to automaticly load hero artwork by providing the env `REPLEX_TMDB_API_KEY`. This way you can keep your backgrounds and hero artwork seperated. 

see https://developer.themoviedb.org/docs/getting-started on how to get an api key. 

## Remote access (force clients to use the proxy)

Because this app sits before Plex the builtin remote access (and auto SSL) will not work and needs to be disabled.

You have 2 options to provide remote access.

1. By ip http://[replexip]:[replexport]

   This option has 2 downsides. One it has no SSL so your connections will be insecure. Second app.plex.tv will not work. As browsers do not allow unsecure connections from a securew website. Gf you want to to use the web ui you can access it by ip. All other clients should work with unsecured connections

2. Custom domain (reverse proxy)

   You can setup a reverse proxy with a custom domain. This solves both the issues from option 1.

For both options set your domain or ip (http://[replexip]:[replexport]) in the 'Custom server access URLs' field under network and make sure to disable remote access under remote access.

## Reverse proxy

If you have a reverse proxy running and only want to route the necessary paths, you can do so. (and all subpaths unless otherwise stated).

- /hubs (excluding /hubs/search)
- /replex

Paths are subject to change.

## Redirect streams

If you have for example an appbox it might not be ideal to stream media trhough replex. As that will take a lot of netowkr resources.
You can redirect streams by enabling `REPLEX_REDIRECT_STREAMS` and optionally set `REPLEX_REDIRECT_STREAMS_URL``
