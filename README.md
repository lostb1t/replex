# Replex

Remix your plex recommendations.

![plot](./examplewithhero.png)

## Features

- Merge recommendations on home into one from different libraries. Aka have movies and shows in a single row.
- Remove watched items from recommendations.
- Choose between styles, shelf (default) or hero.
- Works on every client/app not only plex web!
- Plays nice with PMM (and without).

!!This does not alter your plex data in anyway. it only alters outgoing api requests. All your collections or rows are kept intact!!

## settings
Settings are set via [environment variables](https://kinsta.com/knowledgebase/what-is-an-environment-variable/) 

| Setting        	         | Default 	| Description                                                            	  |
|--------------------------|----------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| REPLEX_HOST              |        	| Plex target host to proxy                                             	  |
| REPLEX_INCLUDE_WATCHED   | false    | If set to false, hide watched items.                                      |
| REPLEX_CACHE_TTL         | 300    	| Time to live for caches in seconds. Set to 0 to disable            	      |

## hub style

You can change the hub style to hero elements by setting the label "REPLEXHERO" on an collection. 

## usage example

_Make sure that the collections you want to merge have the same name in your different libraries as the merge happens by name. 
Example: an collection named "Trending" in a Movie library will be merged with an collection named "Trending" from a shows library on home._

Run the docker image with REPLEX_HOST set to your plex instance.

```
docker run --rm -it -p 3001:80 -e REPLEX_HOST="http://10.0.0.3:42405" ghcr.io/sarendsen/replex:latest
```

add your proxy url to plex "Custom server access URLs" (ex http://0.0.0.0:3001)

then access your proxy url http://0.0.0.0:3001

Docker compose example including plex:

```yml
version: "3"
services:
  plex:
    image: lscr.io/linuxserver/plex:latest
    container_name: plex
    environment:
      - PUID=1000
      - PGID=1000
      - TZ=Etc/UTC
      - VERSION=docker
      # claim from https://plex.tv/claim 
      - PLEX_CLAIM=
    ports:
      - 32400:32400
     volumes:
       - /path/to/library:/config
       - /path/to/tvseries:/tv
       - /path/to/movies:/movies
    restart: unless-stopped
  replex:
    image: ghcr.io/sarendsen/replex:latest
    container_name: replex
    environment:
      REPLEX_HOST: http://plex:32400
    ports:
      - 3001:80
    restart: unless-stopped
    depends_on:
      - plex
```

## Remote access (force clients to use the proxy)

Because this app sits before Plex the builtin remote access (and auto SSL) will not work and needs to be disabled.

You have 2 options to provide remote access.

1. By ip http://[replexip]:[replexport]

   This option has 2 downsides. One it has no SSL so your connections will be insecure. Second app.plex.tv will not work. As browsers do not allow unsecure connections from a securew website. Gf you want to to use the web ui you can access it by ip. All other clients should work with unsecured connections

2. Custom domain (reverse proxy)

   You can setup a reverse proxy with a custom domain. This solves both the issues from option 1.

For both options set your domain or ip (http://[replexip]:[replexport]) in the 'Custom server access URLs' field under network and make sure to disable remote access under remote access.

## Reverse proxy

If you have a reverse proxy running and only want to route the necessary paths, you can do so. (and all subpaths unless otherwise stated).

- /hubs (excluding /hubs/search)
- /replex

Paths are subject to change.
